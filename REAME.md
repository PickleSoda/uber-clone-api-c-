Here's an expanded version of your README file for the Uber Clone REST API, including more details about the architecture, setup, and features:

# Uber Clone REST API

## Overview

This project aims to create a REST API for an Uber-like application using clean architecture principles. The API includes modules for managing trips, users, payments, notifications, and reporting.

## Use Case Diagram

### Subdomains and Bounded Contexts

For the clean architecture setup, it's essential to identify the subdomains and bounded contexts of the application. These will help in defining the scope of different modules and their interactions.

#### Subdomains

- **Trip Management**: Handling trip lifecycle, including creation, updates, and termination.
- **User Management**: Handling user profiles, authentication, and authorization.
- **Payment Processing**: Managing payment methods and processing payments.
- **Notifications**: Sending alerts and messages to users.
- **Reporting**: Generating reports for admin users about usage and activity.

```bash
+------------------------------------+
|              System                |
+------------------------------------+
       |                |             |
   [Passenger]    [Driver]        [Admin]
       |                |             |
+---------+-------+  +-----+-----+  +-------------+
|Create Trip      |  |Accept Trip|  |Manage Users |
|Cancel Trip      |  |Complete Trip| |View Reports |
|Rate Trip        |  |Update Status| +-------------+
|View Trip History|  +-------------+
|Add Payment Method|
+-------------------+
        |              |
        +------> [System] <----+
                |Send Notifications|
                +------------------+
```
